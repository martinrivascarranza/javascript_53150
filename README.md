Kettlebell Shopping Cart
This repository contains the JavaScript code for the shopping cart functionality of my work called KettlebellProject shopping website, this work is the second part of my first course at CoderHouse 'Web Develpment'. 
The code is written in JavaScript and demonstrates basic concepts of DOM manipulation,
